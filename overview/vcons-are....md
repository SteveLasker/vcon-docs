# ðŸŒŽ The Big Picture

## vCons are "PDFs" for Conversations

A vCon describes a conversation that involves a "natural" person.  As a simple example, a vCon could be created from the last conversation you had with a customer service agent.  Just like PDFs allow you to create and share any written document; vCons allow you to create and share any human conversation. A vCon identifies the people in the call, recordings and transcripts, analysis and supporting attachments, like documents and logs.  Implemented in easy to manage JSON, vCons are both encryptable and tamper proof.&#x20;

## vCons are an Essential Tool in the Management of Personal Data

By defining the contents and participants of a conversation, vCons enable software tools that are able assert the presence, the absence and the authenticity of personal and biometric information. By tracking and consolidating the interactions with external systems with personal data, vCons enable responsible management of "Right to be Forgotten" regulations.  vCons are best understood as a functional toolset for fine-grained control of personal information, authenticity, context and ethical treatment of personal data. &#x20;

## Are vCons Open?

Yes, vCons are both an open source project, it is also an open standards effort supported by the IETF.   vCons enable the Internet to work better by defining the interchange standard for our most personal information: the sounds of of voice, and the images of our face.  vCons enable the responsible management of personal data, enabling true compliance to customer data protections such as "Right to Know".&#x20;

## vCons are mostly After the Fact

Although you can build a vCon as a conversation happens, they are mostly understood to be an expression of a conversation that happened. vCons are primarily concerned with the responsible use of recorded conversations of all kinds.  vCons are intended to be an effective tool for companies seeking GDPR compliance while handling recorded business conversations, which often contain sensitive biometric data. &#x20;

## The Conserver is Asterisk for AI

The Conserver is an open source framework that creates and collects vCons from other systems, including Freeswitch, Bria, Volie, Asterisk and many others.  By centralizing conversations in a single place, they can be responsibly managed, shared and analyzed.  The Conserver is a database for conversations, and appears to other network elements as data sources or events.

## The Conserver is also "Rails for vCons"; "Asterisk for AI"

Like Ruby on Rails, the Conserver contains "best practice by default" for the responsible management of biometric information.  Conserver contains a reasonable series of defaults to protect company reputations by protecting customer data.

The conserver is an open source framework that aggregates conversations from telephone, chat, messaging and video systems, from the cloud to the premise.  The conserver keeps these conversations safe: redacting, analyzing and projecting them into other systems.  vCons are either created by external systems, or are created inside the conserver.

## vCons is the CDR Format for the age of AI

The conserver and vCons allows data controllers to be compliant  in the age of AI:

* vCons track the external systems, including AI, transcribers, redactors and analysis, enabling an authoritative answer to "What systems have seen my personal data?"
* vCons and the conserver enable compliance to GDPR requirements, including "Right to Know", "Right to be Forgotten" and for responding to regulator audits for sensitive biometric information
* vCons and the conserver allow you to share conversations across security boundaries, tracking shared data and requesting remote deletion.&#x20;
