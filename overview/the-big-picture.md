# ðŸŒŽ The Big Picture

## vCons are PDFs for Conversations

A vCon is created to describe a conversation that involves a "natural" person.  A vCon identifies the people in the call, recordings and transcripts, analysis and supporting attachments, like documents and logs. vCons are currently on the standards track at the IETF.

## vCons are mostly After the Fact

Although you can build a vCon as a conversation happens, they are mostly understood to be an expression of a conversation that happened. vCons are primarily concerned with the responsible use of recorded conversations of all kinds.  vCons are intended to be an effective tool for companies seeking GDPR compliance while handling recorded business conversations, which often contain sensitive biometric data. &#x20;

## The Conserver is "Rails for vCons"; "Asterisk for AI"

Like Ruby on Rails, the Conserver contains "best practice by default" for the responsible management of biometric information.  Conserver contains a reasonable series of defaults to protect company reputations by protecting customer data.

The conserver is an open source framework that aggregates conversations from telephone, chat, messaging and video systems, from the cloud to the premise.  The conserver keeps these conversations safe: redacting, analyzing and projecting them into other systems.  vCons are either created by external systems, or are created inside the conserver.

## vCons is the CDR Format for the age of AI

The conserver and vCons allows data controllers to be compliant  in the age of AI:

* vCons track the external systems, including AI, transcribers, redactors and analysis, enabling an authoritative answer to "What systems have seen my personal data?"
* vCons and the conserver enable compliance to GDPR requirements, including "Right to Know", "Right to be Forgotten" and for responding to regulator audits for sensitive biometric information
* vCons and the conserver allow you to share conversations across security boundaries, tracking shared data and requesting remote deletion.&#x20;
